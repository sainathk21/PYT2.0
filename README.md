# PickYourTrail SiteMap

To run this code, you will need to have PDO Installed. Every other dependent file is taken from a CDN.

Note : There are two changes that need to be made in order to get this code to run properly.

1) Replace line 4 of index.php with either a config file with database credentials, or the credentials themselves.
2) Between line 10 and 25 - Replace 'pyt' with your database name (or remove it), and $indidb with your PDO database object.

Please reach out to me if there are any issues with the installation, I can also self host it if needed.
